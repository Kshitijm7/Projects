## My Contribution
I get an opportunity to work on one of its feature called Automated Savings. Using this feature user can automate his/her savings without getting out of cash.
Within this feature user can setup his/her goals (for what he/she wanted save for) and saving rules (when, how much and from where to save money), Multiple rules can be used to save for particular goal and multiple goals can be ruled by single rule. It is a many to many relationship. This is a unique feature into capitally even one of the core feature of the application.

## RESULT:

The project "Automated Savings" has been successfully implemented as a module in the "Capitally" app. The goal of this project was to provide users with a feature that automates their savings according to their defined goals.

### Goals:

To achieve the goal of automating savings for users, we have created an activity within the app where users can view and manage all their previously set goals. Additionally, they have the option to create new goals as needed. To store and preserve user settings and data, we utilized a local SQLite database on Android devices.

### Rules:

To facilitate automated savings, we have developed an intuitive user interface that enables users to create custom rules based on pre-existing basic rules. These rules act as guidelines, specifying when, how much, and from where the funds should be saved to reach their respective goals. It is essential for each rule to be associated with at least one goal to save for; otherwise, the rule will be marked as paused.
